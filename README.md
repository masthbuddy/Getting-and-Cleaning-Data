# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
* This repository contains the solution for the Coursera Assignment of Getting and Cleaning Data Course. 

* The dataset being used is:  [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Installation and Running the R script

* Download the zip data file and extract it. Inside it, you will find the folder 'UCI HAR Dataset'. 
* Make sure that 'UCI HAR Dataset' and the downloaded run_analysis.R file are in the same parent folder.
* The R script makes use of the library 'dplyr'. Install it if not done already.
* Run the script run_anaysis.R. It produces an output file called 'group_mean_tidy_data.txt' in the same folder as the script.
